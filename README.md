### I'm Sarah! ðŸ–¤

Hey! Thanks for checking out my profile. I'm Sarah (she/her), I'm 19 and I live in Germany. I'm currently studying IT. ðŸŽ“

I mostly develop in C, C++ and Kotlin, but I also work with Java and JavaScript sometimes. I do some embedded stuff, too.

Nowadays I mostly do some light Minecraft modding, but I also start a lot of side projects which are never going to be finished.
