### I'm Sarah! ðŸ–¤

Hey! Thanks for checking out my profile. I'm Sarah (she/her), I'm 18 and I live in Germany. Currently I'm studying IT. ðŸŽ“

I mostly develop in C and C++, but I also work with Java and JavaScript a lot. I also do some embedded stuff!

You can find a lot of random projects on my profile. Don't expect *that* many updates. I'm mostly working on my C/C++ Duinocoin library [libduco](https://github.com/SarahIsWeird/libduco) lately. Check it out if you're into that kinda stuff! ðŸ˜Š
